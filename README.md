# Tri NIT Hackthon-2023
This is a crop prediction project that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the type of crop that can be grown in a specific district based on soil nutrient values (n, p,k, and ph). The project consists of two files, api.py and user_app.py.

# Getting Started
***
To run the project, follow the steps below:
* Clone this repository on your local machine
* Navigate to the project directory
* Install requirements
* Run the api.py file to start the machine learning model
* In a new terminal window, run the user_app.py file to start the user interface
